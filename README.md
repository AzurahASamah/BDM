![WBDM](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQGH0S-uUENvNQ/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1520206428749?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=22-VhN5U90hQDZFtdhy6YT5KxQdCmV9kLX7fzgPQS_0)

## Course Synopsis
This course provides a basic fundamental of big data architecture and management.  Students will learn the big data processes and the current big data technologies that are available. Further, students will be exposed to the big data platform ecosystem for big data manipulation. The big data management will be explored for the best practice in managing and manipulating large amount of data. At the end of the course, students should be able to understand the architecture and management of big data and also can develop simple application of big data handling using particular platform in assignment.

## Course Learning Outcomes
1. Understand the technology for managing, processing and manipulating large amount of data.
2. Design big data platform demonstrating the implementation of big data applications.
3. Discuss current technology that support for sustainability of the big data platform ecosystem.
